## Starting cohorts

There are three ways to start a rally for individual entrants:- 

Single mass start : Every entrant starts at the same time, the official rally start time.

Multiple mass starts : Entrants are grouped into cohorts, with each cohort starting at a designated time.

Start with first claim : Each entrant's rally start time is triggered by his first bonus claim.

The system allocates each entrant to a single cohort and that cohort's parameters control that entrant's start method and time. Initially, all entrants are assigned to cohort 0 with settings chosen during initial rally setup and later via Rally Settings.
