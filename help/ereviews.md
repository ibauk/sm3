## Review scorecards

This is used in place of the old directly-accessed scorecards to facilitate both team review and entrant acceptance of individual scorecards. It is useful in two circumstances: whenever the rally team wishes to review some or all scorecards to ensure compliance and at the end of the rally to gain and record the entrant's acceptance of the scorecard.

The picklist shows two columns of ticks, the first using the '&#10003;' character to indicate team satisfaction, the second using the '&#10004;' character to indicate the entrant's acceptance. The first column can also show the '&#10007;' to indicate the team's dissatisfaction with the scorecard.

Individual scorecards are shown with two panels, one showing the score explanation given to entrants and one showing all relevant claims. Claims can be updated from here with the scorecard being recalculated to include the changes.

Each scorecard can be marked as "Reviewed by Team" or "Queried by Team" and can also be marked as "Accepted by Entrant".
