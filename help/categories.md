## Category combinations
Simple combination bonuses specify exactly which underlying bonuses must be visited, Arsenal + Chelsea football clubs for example. A category combination is scored when a minimum number of, say football clubs, is visited.

Such combination bonuses may be specified for a particular category, football clubs, or for all categories. For example itâ€™s possible to score extra points when visiting at least five bonuses in any category.

The value of the bonus can be layered with, for example, five visits scoring an extra 2500 points, seven visits scoring 5000.

Categories are also useful for enabling rules such as *must score three bonuses in each of two categories*.
