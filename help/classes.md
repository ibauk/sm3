## Certificate classes

Each entrant is assigned a single “class”. This enables production of different certificates for each class. One use of this facility would be to have one certificate for podium finishers and another for everyone else or perhaps a different text for trike riders.

This can be manually set per entrant and this is the method used to produce different certificates for each route in the RBLR1000

Classes may also be set automatically using other scoring information such as points scored, number of ordinary bonuses visited, particular bonuses visited or scored and finisher ranking.
