## Bonuses: ordinary, special

Bonuses are the basic unit of scoring. Each rally will use its own mixture of bonuses, implementing each rally's unique design or geography. They are presented on the scorecard using their *bonusid* which will often be a two or three digit number. 

Individual bonuses may be marked as *Compulsory* so that failure to score a compulsory bonus results in the entrant being DNF.

Bonuses may have a variable rather than fixed points value with the actual value being entered when scoring each entrant. They may also have a *multiplier* value when used in a [compound scoring](help:compound) scheme.

Bonuses can also be used to record rest or sleep period. This is used when calculating [overall average speed](help:speeding) and may be used to enforce rest period in longer rallies.

### Ordinary

Ordinary bonuses typically represent geographical locations that must be visited and each will have a number of points associated with it. 

### Special

Special bonuses are used for a variety of arbitrary bonuses (or indeed penalties). They can be grouped to use radio buttons rather than checkboxes. Specials may also be marked as *MustNot* so that scoring such a bonus results in DNF. This feature can be used for example to disqualify an entrant for "arguing with the rally team".
