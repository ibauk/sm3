## Team Ranking
Each bike entered in the rally is an entrant and will have a rider and possibly a pillion passenger. Where two or more bikes ride together they form a team. The exact rules governing teams will vary from rally to rally. In some cases team-based scoring will be used, sometimes not. Teams generally must remain together throughout the rally and must declare themselves to be a team.

If team scoring is in effect then each team member is assigned either highest or lowest individual rank, depending on the option chosen for the rally. In this case, both TotalPoints and CorrectedMiles are taken from the chosen individual and applied to all team members for ranking purposes only. Their values on individual entrant records are unchanged.

When team-scoring is in effect the place awarded to all team members is counted only once per team. Consider the following:-


Entrant | Team | Points | Individual Place | Highest place | Lowest place
---     | ---  | ---    | :---:            | :---:         | :---:
Bob     | Team B | 9000 | 1 | 1 | 3 
Dave    | Team A | 9000 | 1 | 1 | 1
Steve   | Team A | 8000 | 3 | 1 | 1
Wilma   | -      | 7000 | 4 | 3 | 2
Gordon  | Team B | 2000 | 5 | 1 | 3
 
It is also possible to specify “team cloning” as the scoring strategy in which case whenever a team member’s scorecard is updated the resultant scores and timings will be replicated to the other team members.
