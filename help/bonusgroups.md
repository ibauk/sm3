# Bonus groups

Bonus groups are used to identify groups of related bonuses for scoring administration purposes. This is entirely unrelated to the categories used for [compound scoring](help:compound). Where scorecards are updated directly, rather than using the claims systems, bonus groups can be specified as using radio buttons rather than checkboxes. This means that scoring consists of choosing one member from a group rather than ticking multiple boxes.

Bonus groups are also used to implement special features such as [rest bonuses](help:rbconfig).

**Beware** bonus group names are case-sensitive!
