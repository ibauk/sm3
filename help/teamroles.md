## Rally team roles

Each rally team typically comprises four discrete roles: Rallymaster, Administrator, Scorer/Judge & Helper. These roles may be executed by a single individual or by many different people. 

- Rallymaster:	The creative controller with overall responsibility for the design of the rally.
- Administrator:	Responsible for tracking scores, producing certificates, etc.
- Scorer/Judge:	Validates claims and captures ridersâ€™ scoresheets.
- Helper:		Checks/records odo readings, bike checks, etc

In the [Iron Butt Rally](https://www.ironbutt.org/ibr/), the term "Rallymaster" refers to the *Administrator* above and the creative controller is a "Rally designer".
