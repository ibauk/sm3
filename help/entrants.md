## Entrants
Entrants are the people actually competing in the rally either as riders (pilots) or pillions (passengers). Typically, details of the entrants are known and captured electronically before the rally starts but in some cases details will only be known at the rally itself.
### Import details
Where electronic details are available (the normal case in IBAUK rallies) they can be imported directly into the scoring database. The import source must be in spreadsheet format (including CSV) and in a known layout, usually with the first row being used as column names. If the imported data includes a serial number, that will/may be used as the unique EntrantID in the scoring database. If no such number is available, records will be assigned the next available number starting with 1.

Complex spreadsheet layouts should be defined in advance. Currently four such specifications are available being BBR, BBL, Invictus and RBLR1000. Simple layouts can be specified at run time using a simple graphical interface showing the data.

Forms are provided offering direct input to the scoring database and these may be used either for new inputs or to modify existing details.
