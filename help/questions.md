# Question and answer pairs

These fields, specified for individual bonuses, may be used to implement a secondary score possibility requiring observation at bonus locations. Each bonus may have a question associated with it ("*What is the name of the caretaker?*") and the associated answer ("*Mr Jones*"). The answer is supplied as the fifth field of a bonus claim. A correct answer will result in an extra point score for the bonus.

The extra points value is set for the whole rally using the setting **valBonusQuestions** held in the rally parameters. Use of these fields is governed by the **useBonusQuestions** setting which defaults to "false".

The extra points are only available for successful claims.
