## TESTING
As with all computer systems and administrative processes, testing of the configured software is vital to the proper running of the rally. Do not assume that it will work as advertised, test it. Do not assume that you have input everything correctly, test it. Do not assume that the information supplied to you was accurate and complete, test it.

If more than one person will be involved in operating ScoreMaster, make sure that everyone is familiar with its operation in advance of having to use it “under fire”.
