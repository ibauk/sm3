# Claims log

The claims log is used when bonus claims are submitted individually rather than as part of a complete scoresheet.

The log records *rider*, *bonus*, *odo reading*, *claim time* and *decision*. Each record is also flagged as being *applied* or *unapplied*
to the relevant scorecard.

By default, the log screen shows **unapplied** claims but options enable showing all claims, selecting **decided** or **undecided** or for a single bonus or rider only.

## New claims

A new claim can be started by clicking the '+' button or pressing \[Enter] on the keyboard. Once started, the claim form can be completed by pasting a suitably formatted 'Subject:' line into the 'Entrant' field. All fields may be overwritten before completion.

Any **unapplied** claim can be updated by clicking on it.

## Applying claims

If you wish, you can update scorecards manually then tick each unapplied claim to show it as 'applied'. Settings control this but by
default all claims are applied automatically.
