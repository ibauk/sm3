## Reasons for claim rejection

Scorecards capture both successful and unsuccessful bonus claims and each unsuccessful claim is marked with a brief reason for rejection, a text picked from a list of nine possibilities held in the RALLYPARAMS database table.

These texts may be customised for each rally but the texts issued with an empty database are :-

1. No/wrong photo
2. Photo unclear
3. Out of hours
4. Face not in photo
5. Bike not in photo
6. Flag not in photo
7. Missing rider/pillion
8. Missing receipt
9. Bad information

These are not intended to provide precise details of rejection and the list is not expandable beyond the nine possibilities.
