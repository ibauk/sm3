## Rally time
Each rally runs from a specified start time and finishes at a specified finish time. Some rallies will apply the same start and finish times to all entrants while others will use individual start and finish times.

The rally’s **official start time** is the earliest start time and its **official finish time** is the latest possible finish time. Individual start times might be later than the official start time and individual finish times might be earlier than the official finish time. For example a rally might specify an overall timeframe of 0700-1900 but entrants are only allowed 10 hours to complete their rally.
### Check-out
Check-out marks the start of an entrant’s rally. Time and odometer readings should be recorded at this point as well as any last minute changes to the riders or bikes. For mass starts, Check-out occurs at the **official start time**; for staggered starts, this will be the individual rider's actual start time. Either way, this starts the clock and the rider now has a maximum of **rideable hours** to complete his rally.
### Check-in
Check-in marks the end of an entrant’s rally. Time and odometer readings should be recorded at this point as well any other administrative functions (such as final claims submission) required by the rally team. This marks the time used to calculate time penalties (if any). If Check-in occurs after the **official finish time** the rider will be DNF.
