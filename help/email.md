# Email facility

ScoreMaster includes a facility to send emails to some or all entrants. It is intended for distributing certificates or other documents produced 
during the course of a rally. It is not intended to be a fully-featured email system and it doesn't always handle edge or error cases as well as it might.

## Entrant selection

Each email can be sent to one or more entrants chosen either by their rally status (Finisher, DNF, etc) or by their entrant number. The number selected by the criteria is shown next [Send email now].

Several entrant numbers may be selected by entering the numbers separated by commas.

## Subject line

The formal subject line of the email must not be blank. Best practice is to make the subject line a self-contained message such as "Your BBR scorecard is here". 

## Body text

The body text, the first box after "Subject line" must also not be blank.

## Include score explanations / claim logs

Emails may include either a score explanation or a claims logged list. This will form part of the regular body text of the email, immediately after the body text entered above.

## Signature block

More body text, included after any score explanation or claims log.

## Attachments

Small files and/or Finisher certificates in PDF form can be attached to the email.
