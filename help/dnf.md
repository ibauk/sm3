## DNF - **D**id **N**ot **F**inish

Any entrant actually starting the rally will be classified as either Finisher or ‘Did Not Finish’. DNF status is applied automatically in a variety of circumstances.

### Finished too late
Each rally specifies a start time, a finish time and a number of hours. The start time is the earliest possible start time for any entrant. The finish time is the latest possible finish time, anyone whose check-in time is later than this is DNF. The number of hours is added to the entrant’s start time to give that entrant’s individual cutoff time, anyone whose check-in time is later than this is DNF.

Some rallies have a fixed common start time applicable to all entrants. In these cases all entrants will also have a common DNF time. Some rallies permit a range of start times, say between 0500-0700. In these cases an individual entrant’s DNF time will be the earlier of the rally finish time and the specified number of hours after that entrant’s start time.
### Rode too far/not far enough
Each rally specifies a minimum, which might be zero, and optionally a maximum distance. Entrants either failing to reach the minimum or exceeding the maximum distance will be DNF.
### Not enough points
Each rally specifies a minimum number of points, which might be zero or even negative, to qualify as a Finisher, anyone not reaching this is DNF.
### Compulsory bonuses
It is possible to flag any ordinary, special or combination bonus as being compulsory. Anyone failing to score any such bonus is DNF. It is also possible to flag special bonuses as ‘must not’. Anyone triggering such a bonus would be DNF.
### Category rule
Bonus category rules may also be used to establish a DNF condition. Simple conditions such as “must score at least one in each of seven categories” are easily specified.

### Excessive speed
Each rally may employ a range of measures designed to deter/punish excessive use of speed. In particular the software provides a mechanism to monitor and sanction overall average speeds. One possible sanction is DNF for those exceeding a specified threshold.
