## Electronic Bonus Claiming - EBC

In the good old days rallies were always conducted only in fine weather as many of the entrants, being *of a certain age*, were unable to adapt to modern technology beyond pen and paper and those don't work well in the rain. At each bonus stop they would carry out whatever task the Rallymaster had set them then record the necessary details on a piece of paper which they carefully preserved until the end of the rally so they could present it for scoring.

Well into the 21st century someone had the bright idea of filing bonus claims electronically and this meant that for the first time it was possible to conduct rallies even when it was raining. (This had the unfortunate side-effect that some rally entrants withdrew from rallying as riding in the rain proved a step too far!)

Email is the chosen carrier, pretty much any version, using pretty much any device: smartphone (even iPhones), tablets, laptops, whatever. Depending on the rules of the individual rally, emails can/should be sent during the rally, from the roadside even, or from the comfort of a hotel room at the end of the rally.

A standard has emerged for the metadata associated with bonus claims. The *Subject:* line of the email should be formatted as:-

>*EntrantNumber* *Bonusid* *OdometerReading* *TimeOfClaim*

That information line can be copied and pasted into a new claim form in the [Claims log](help:claimslog) to efficiently record the claim.

WhatsApp (Signal, Telegram, etc) could also be used as a carrier but it's suitable only for very low claim volumes. Incoming email queues are far more suitable in terms of [data control](help:datacontrol) and efficiency.

### EBC claims judging

Emails may be automatically extracted into the ScoreMaster database and presented for judging using a simple form rather than using the copy/paste method above. This feature is enabled by a background process continuously monitoring the incoming email account (which may be different to the one used for 
outgoing emails).
