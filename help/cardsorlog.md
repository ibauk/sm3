## Scorecards or Claims log?

The short answer is - claims log, preferably using [EBC](help:ebc). This is the 21st century, nobody uses paper any more.

Ultimately the rally results (scores, ranks, certificates) are produced from the scorecards so these must be updated. If your data capture procedures involve receiving completed scoresheets from individual entrants, the normal for post-rally scoring, you can post those details directly to the individual scorecards. In this case the Claims log is redundant and will not be updated.

If bonus claims are being received or processed individually, when using [Electronic Bonus Claiming](help:ebc) for example, it is much better to post them to the [Claims log](help:claimslog) and use that to automatically update the scorecards. If done this way it is possible to carry out one or more [Scorecard reconcilations](help:recon) in order to ensure accuracy and boost confidence in the results.

**You should not post some claims to the log and others directly to the scorecards** as to do so will remove the ability to reconcile the results and may lead to inaccurate scoring.
