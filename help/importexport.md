## Import/export - data integration

ScoreMaster is designed to make integration with other IBA systems easy. Let's face it, we're lazy buggers and nobody enjoys keying stuff in more than once!

## Importing entrants

People sign up for IBA events by filling in online forms and those details can be sucked straight into ScoreMaster using the *Import Entrants* function. If the incoming data is in a known format - like from one of those online forms for example - you just choose the appropriate format from the dropdown list and Bob's your uncle. If you've just made up some arbitrary format all is not lost! Select your file then use the dropdown column headers to map the file columns to ScoreMaster fields, simples.

## Importing ordinary bonuses

So you've spent all year entering details of your bonuses into your favourite spreadsheet and you're now faced with the prospect of entering them all over again. Fear not, just use the *Import ordinary bonuses* routine, mapping the columns using the dropdown column headers. You'll still have to enter specials and combos manually but at least the ordinary bonuses are done.

## Importing combinations

Combos can also be imported directly from spreadsheets in the same way as for ordinary bonuses.

## Exporting finishers

After every rally some poor bugger has to update the permanent IBA database with details of all the finishers. Thank heavens for the *Export finishers* procedure which generates a CSV file in just the right format to be imported directly into the Rides database.

## Exporting entrants into some wildly inappropriate spreadsheet

If, despite all the evidence to the contrary, you desperately need to have entrant details in some random spreadsheet you've knocked up for whatever reason, you can just export the entire entrant record, all of them, even those who did not start the rally, to a CSV. Click *Export entrants records* from the *Utility functions* menu.
