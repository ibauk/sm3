## Multi-Leg rallies

Most rallies consist of a single *Leg*, a single scoring event, but longer multi-day rallies sometimes divide into two or more Legs, each of which is scored separately.

Bonus and combo records can be available throughout the rally or can be flagged for use in a single Leg. Time and speed penalties can also be flagged as appplicable in a specific Leg. (Where time penalties use relative times, they should also specify whch Leg they refer to.)

At the end of each Leg, the Leg should be rolled over using the control panel in the Rally Params. At the end of the rally, Leg 0 should be chosen so that certificates and other reporting refers to the rally as a whole and not just the final leg.
