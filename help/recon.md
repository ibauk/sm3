## Scorecard reconciliation

Scorecards can be reconciled using information from the [Claims log](help:claimslog) or other records as a way of assuring accuracy and confidence in the results.

Reconciliations are usually carried out by two team members, one examining the scorecard and the other examining the log or other trail. 

The simplest approach is to use the [Review scorecards](help:ereviews) mechanism.
