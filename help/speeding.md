## Speed penalties

We are not the police! It is not our job to police the roads and we do not have the resources available to the police to counter speeding. Also not everyone agrees that we should even be monitoring speeds **but**

ScoreMaster calculates overall average speed of entrants during the rally using information obtained during **Check-out** and **Check-in** as well as information obtained during live bonus claiming and information about [rest periods](help:rest) and includes that figure on [score explanations](help:scorex).

If no penalty records are entered no action will be taken otherwise a penalty may be applied: either be DNF or a fixed number of penalty points deducted from the score.

Multiple records are entered to trigger penalties at different speeds. Only one such record will be applied to an entrant’s score and it will be the one with the highest speed equal to or lower than the entrant’s calculated average speed.
