## Data control

This is concerned with information management, knowing how many claims are oustanding for example. Data control is perhaps the single most important function of the [Rally Administrator](help:teamroles). If data are properly managed it will always be possible to detect and correct mistakes and omissions. If not then your only weapon is to ensure that the gods are smiling on you.

Before completing any rally stage make sure that ALL claims have been received and processed. Always obtain the entrant's agreement to his scorecard. Keep track  of any queries raised afterwards.
