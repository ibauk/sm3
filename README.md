# ScoreMaster
ScoreMaster provides a range of scoring and administrative facilities for IBA-style rallies without requiring technical expertise to make them fit whatever new twists Rallymasters devise. This is achieved by including a range of configurable scoring methods including simple addition of points, simple and exponential multipliers, bonus combinations and categories as well as providing data manipulation, data transfer and data control facilities.

ScoreMaster provides for tight integration with other IBAUK data systems including acquisition of entrant details and publication of rally results.
