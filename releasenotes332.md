# ScoreMaster v3.3.2

I am delighted to announce the release of ScoreMaster v3.3.2 incorporating the following:-

## Bonus claims limit
It is now possible to impose a limit on the number of bonuses claimed by an entrant. Where a limit is applied, claims exceeding the limit will be flagged as excluded

## Distance limited claims
It is now possible to exclude bonus claims beyond a specified riding distance limit.

## Non-existent bonus claims
Claims for non-existent bonus codes are now explicitly rejected, including on score explanations.


## EBCFetch v1.7.2
This release includes the latest upgrade of the electronic bonus claim fetcher with these improvements:-

### Registered emails
Registered email test can now be configured to test against any registered email for testing purposes rather than only the right one.
