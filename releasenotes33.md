# ScoreMaster v3.3

I am delighted to announce the release of ScoreMaster v3.3 incorporating the following significant changes:-

- Rest bonus start/finish handling
- Offline odo capture
- EBC evidence peeking
- Batched ScoreX printing
- Show quicklist in finisher order rather than rank
- Automap suppression on import template selection
- Rank by points per mile(km) rather than total points
- Fractional multipliers

## Rest bonus start/finish
Special rest bonus handling is provided to enable the use of separate start and finish claims rather than a single claim with two receipts. This method of handling is optional and requires the use of special coding within the rally database. Finish claims are matched with start claims enabling rapid validation of claims.

## Offline odo capture
Odo readings and check-out/check-in times can now be captured using offline devices such as iPads. Readings are automatically updated when connection to the database is re-established.
