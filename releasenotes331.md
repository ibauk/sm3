# ScoreMaster v3.3.1

I am delighted to announce the release of ScoreMaster v3.3.1 incorporating the following:-

## Out of sequence reclaims
By default, entrants may submit multiple claims for each bonus subject only to any time constraints imposed by the rally rules. It is now possible to stipulate that reclaims are only permitted until the next bonus is claimed. Disbarred claims are now flagged in EBC judging and when entering new claims using the claims log. The scorer can override te decision.

## Compound calculations
If no category records exist when creating compound calculation records, the need to establish category records first is now made explicit.

##  Review scorecards
The "team happy" and "entrant happy" buttons have now been replaced with a single dropdown offering "Awaiting review", "Team is happy", "Team is NOT happy" and "Entrant is happy".
Updated claim decisions are now always reapplied.

## EBC judging
When choosing the "Leave undecided" option, the claim is now moved to the bottom of the list of claims to be judged. Any notes entered will be abandoned for this claim as they are relevant only to decided claims, partly decided is not an option.
