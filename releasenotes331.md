# ScoreMaster v3.3.1

I am delighted to announce the release of ScoreMaster v3.3.1 incorporating the following:-

## Compound calculations
If no category records exist when creating compound calculation records, the need to establish category records first is now made explicit.

##  Review scorecards
The "team happy" and "entrant happy" buttons have now been replaced with a single dropdown offering "Awaiting review", "Team is happy", "Team is NOT happy" and "Entrant is happy".
Updated claim decisions are now always reapplied.

## EBC judging
When choosing the "Leave undecided" option, the claim is now moved to the bottom of the list of claims to be judged. Any notes entered will be abandoned for this claim as they are relevant only to decided claims, partly decided is not an option.
